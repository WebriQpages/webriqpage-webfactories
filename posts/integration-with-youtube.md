Webfactories now provides you the ability to upload videos, respond to comments and retrieve and report on YouTube analytics. These functions are conveniently placed alongside many other facets of our Content Management System and our Social Media dashboard.

Video can be a very powerful tool for businesses of any size, but YouTube‘s free-to-use model, ease of use and mass market audience means it’s a great channel for small businesses. However, like any tool, in order to get the most of it, it needs to be used well.

Here’s a list of effective ways you can use YouTube in your business.

### 1. Create a Branded YouTube Channel

This step is often overlooked by small businesses. Your YouTube channel is basically your house for the videos you create and upload, the videos you have selected as favorites, and those that you have organized into a playlist.

A customized channel gives you the opportunity to add and showcase your company’s branding with specific colors, information and links to your website and/or relevant social media pages. A channel also gives viewers an option to subscribe to your content with the click of a button.

### 2. Make Sure Your Content Fills a Relevant Need

Aim to provide videos to help people effectively manage their Social Media activity. Post recordings of webinars with industry experts and screencasted how-to tutorials on using services on a wide variety of topics . By doing this you create valuable information and interest in you and your company thus generating loyalty and trust.

### 3. Develop Videos that are Quick, Simple, Engaging, and Professional

Decent video cameras are no longer expensive, so you can make a professional video without breaking the bank. Pay attention to lighting the area, sound quality and shakiness of the camera. Your best bet is to use a tripod. It is important to plan an outline and a script prior to making your video. Much like writing a story, you will want to include a beginning, middle and end. Make sure your video has a purpose. Keep it simple and short. It’s recommend 2-4 minutes for a video.
