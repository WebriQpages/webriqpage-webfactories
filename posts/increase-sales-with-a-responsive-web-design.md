Luckily, there are a few relatively simple updates you can make to your website that can have a huge impact on customer attraction and retention, sales, revenue and long-term brand loyalty. These steps don't require hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment and can be implemented by small companies and multinational corporations alike.

There are five common areas that most company websites can improve upon and expect to see an immediate boost in revenue. Taken together, they have the potential to increase your revenue by quite substantially depending, of course, on your industry, location and a variety of other factors.

### 1. Add video content

Consumers love video — and so should you.

Our brains process visual information 60,000 times faster than text, so ditch the long-winded product descriptions and opt for dynamic video content visitors can engage with on your website. Videos on your landing page can increase conversion rates by 86%, and 44% of customers purchase more products on sites that provide informational videos — and these numbers are only rising.

Customers also tend to stay longer on sites with videos, and even better — they are more likely to return. Engaging product videos, customer testimonials and even tours of your work space can help increase conversions.

### 2. Go multilingual and multicultural

The global economic potential of online communication totals $45 trillion. But if your site only offers content in English, you miss out on a whopping two-thirds of that market potential. Making your website available for multilingual — and multicultural — audiences will help you reach a much bigger slice of the pie, improving your overall market potential by as much as 200%.

And if you want to pick one language instead of a variety of languages, go with Spanish for obvious reasons.

Beyond translation, it’s important to be sensitive to the different cultural norms of your markets.

In your face marketing and sales messages might not be the best way to position your products and markets in f.ex. Asian markets.

### 3. Prevent downtime

On Cyber Monday, Amazon sold 36.8 million items worldwide. Minutes of downtime could have cost the company a big chunk of change. Same goes for your site. If it isn’t loading fast enough, you can lose customers before they even get a glimpse of your content and products. In fact, 57% of visitors abandon a website if it takes more than six seconds to load. It’s important that your website is resilient and scales to meet demand, since 24% of people cite downtime as the reason they abandoned their shopping carts.

Improving your site’s scalability will prevent slow load-times and downtime, ultimately keeping more customers on your website and driving more purchases. Make sure to build your website on a cloud platform that maintains your content and application quality, even when major traffic surges hit. And make sure to frequently test out your page speed on Google.

### 4. Use responsive web designs

The majority of consumers access sites from multiple devices, so implement responsive design to provide a consistent visitor experience no matter where customers are accessing content. This year, over 30% of all ecommerce transactions are expected to take place on mobile or tablet. Responsive design gives you the opportunity to take advantage of those sales, and also eases your back-end site management and ups your SEO.

Make sure you're using a modern Content Management platform like [WebriQ](http://www.webriq.us/) , which make it easy to enable responsive site design. Need more convincing? Think about responsive design as a way to future-proof your content, not just for various screen sizes and resolutions, but also for digital experiences on new devices introduced as the Internet of Things takes flight.

### 5. Post relevant blogs and customer testimonials

It’s important to include great content for your site visitors throughout the entire path to purchase, and some of the most important pieces of content on your site are customer reviews.

According to Forrester Research, consumers trust brand recommendations from friends 70% of the time, and ads only 10% of the time. Consumer reviews act as this kind of friendly recommendation on your product page. Make sure to include them on your site — and expect to see an 18% uplift in sales online.

 Adjustments like these can yield huge results for your bottom line business goals. Don't be afraid to test out new methods and techniques to make your content more engaging and your site more cost-effective overall. The most important thing to keep in mind? Your customer. Making your website as accessible as possible is key to increasing sales and improving revenue.
