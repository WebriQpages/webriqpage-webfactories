Marketing has always been an art and a science, but the growth in underlying technology requires business owners to have access to technology talent.</li><li>Align your organizational goals of attracting, acquiring and retaining customers across the many digital channels with current and future technology landscape.</li><li>Take any savings from your offline marketing activities straight in to digital marketing activities, reinvest those funds into more of what's working well.</li><li>Take a fresh look at your corporate website and online advertising activities such as search engine marketing â€” don't let either run on autopilot.
