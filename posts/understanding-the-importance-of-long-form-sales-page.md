Selling stuff online isn't an easy job. You need to invest a good amount of time, money and efforts into making your products and services reach a wider group of targeted audience. If you're thinking about selling something online, a well-defined, eye-catchy website should top your list of priorities. Equipping your corporate website with a long landing page is perhaps an excellent technique of growing your sales by huge bounds and leaps. Keep on reading this post to know more about the vital role played by a long form sales page in enhancing the conversion rate of a business website.

### Concise landing pages VS Long landing Pages

Quite similar to the concise landing pages, even the long landing pages have been successful in creating a unique niche of their own. While the short landing pages contain just enough content to make a sale, the long-form sales page serve as viable means of telling your story and setting a perfect stage for conversion.

### Situations where having a long-form sales page for your e-sales website does all the 'MAGIC' 

<h4>1. When your products/services cost a hefty sum of cash</h4>

Online buyers tend to get anxious while purchasing things  from web-based stores. Therefore, as an e-merchant, it is your responsibility to include as much copy in your website as possible so as to entice the customer about your range of products and services. Since a bigger price tag is accompanied by greater number of objections, it is recommended to take out the required amount of time for countering each query placed on your landing page. It is here that a long-form sales page has a significant role to play. Such a page allows you to clear up the customer's fears as to whether they'll be receiving enough value for the amount that they'll be spending.

<h4>2. When your prospects aren't much familiar with solutions available for their problem</h4>

On the basis of varying level of awareness of your prospect, you'll be required to provide varying degrees of information in order to make them hit the 'Buy' button. Therefore, including a long-form sales page is what you need to do in order to address the prospect in accordance to his/her current state of awareness. However, if you are unaware about the potential customer's level of familiarity with the solutions rendered by you, then it becomes essential for you to find out the same for striking the right argument. It is here that including a long copy within your website makes the prospects comfortable with the solutions you have in store for them.

<h4>3. When your web design is overpowering your business message</h4>

Well, it is a known fact that going plain or ugly with your web design isn't the right way to get maximum conversions. You need to have a gorgeous design for your long-form sales page while ensuring that the message is being conveyed in the right way. Make sure that cool graphics and eye-catchy photos aren't getting into the way of getting your business message across the targeted audience.

<h4>4. When your product/service has multiple moving parts</h4>

Well, more the number of features available in your product/service, the more copy you'll have to include on your landing page. There is a specific correlation between the cost/complexity of a product/service offering and the length of the website landing page.

<h4>5. When your story isn't compelling the visitors positively</h4>

Irrespective of the product/service that you're selling via your website,the prospects might require a lot of information for getting converted into high-paying leads. It is your landing page's copy which can tell a compelling story and motivate potential customers to undertake major purchases. It is highly advised to key in the pain of your prospects and reflect the same back to them along with a promise of rendering a solution as they choose to scroll down the landing page.

### Here's a look at some renowned websites which reveal the incredible elevation in their conversion rate/sales after having equipped with a long landing page

#### Case Study 1 - Martin Chuck's official website

Martin Chuck, the popular American Football coach follows a perfect landing page campaign for his official website. In addition to a long landing page, there is a lot of informative content that has the potential of keeping football fans engaged for a longer duration of time. Right from free football tips to informative details about the benefits associated with different products provided by Martin Chuck, the long landing page has it all.

In addition to above, the landing page also includes an opt-in form which constantly reminds the visitors to get on-board by simply entering their valid email address. Just like Martin Chuck did, you too(as an online marketer) can take complete advantage of this opt-in form on your long landing page. Since you never know when the visitor is in a good mood about a particular deal/offer, it is this opt-in form which will let him/her showcase his/her interest in the same rightaway.

#### Case Study 2 - Nugenix website

People behind Nugenix have also opted for a long landing page. It is quite interesting to see how the site's landing page has been filled with compelling content comprising of textual product(s) description, product(s) images, technical information about product(s), how to use instructions, reasons as to why free testosterone is vital for men, a comparison with competitors like Testofen® Fenugreek Extract 50% Fenuside™, Zinc, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, L-Citrulline Malate and Tribulus Terrestris and some excellent testimonials provided by genuine clients. Not to forget, the page also includes a lead generation/sales form wherein the visitors can insert their relevant details. Plus, towards the top of the landing page, there is a blue colored button that reads as “Click Here to Claim a Sample”.

Visitors can choose to click on this button to get redirected to the bottom of the page where they'll find a 'See If You Qualify for a Sample' form with the following fields:

<ul class="circle-list"><li>First Name- Users are expected to enter their first name in this field.</li><li>Age- Users are expected to enter their current age in this field.</li><li>Why are you looking to boost free testosterone- This is a dropdown menu which is used by visitors for specifying the reason why they are on the Nugenix website. Options available for users include: Boost Libido, Healthy Aging, Feel Stronger and All of the Above.</li></ul>

After specifying a reason, the users can finally click on 'Proceed to Qualify' button for sending their application to qualify for a free sample by Nugenix.   

Although the landing page of Nugenix is long, it does have a caliber of retaining the attention of visitors who are on a look out for the right testosterone booster. No doubts, the ever-increasing conversion rate of Nugenix has actually made Nugenix the winner of GNC's 2013 Innovative Product of the year.

As per my personal experience with creating websites that need to include a long landing page, I believe including one or more forms(like the See If You Quality For a Sample form) on Nugenix's landing page would have probably added weightage to the entire website and made it quite convenient for the visitors to get converted into long-lasting clients.

#### Conclusion

Whether you're promoting a product as an affiliate or one of your own, the sooner you realize the importance of a long-form sales page, the better it is. By enjoying a greater exposure of your business profile, it becomes convenient for you to gather the eye-balls of a wider population of customers who're on a look out for products and services similar to the ones offered by you.
