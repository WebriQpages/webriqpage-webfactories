Mobile application usage is incessantly elevating with the increasing craze for smart devices, which can be compounded to their fabulous features and benefits. 

You will be surprised to note that besides the huge popularity of mobile applications, there is a plethora of apps that are flawed. Thus, it is essential to steer clear of app development mistakes and get all the basic things right to ensure app engagement with users, and its surefire success in the market. 

Irrespective of the type of application that you are developing, there are several factors that can reflect if your app will be successful. In this article, I will unleash a few of the critical factors that can indicate the likelihood of app success. Keeping these factors in mind will help you deliver a prolific mobile application.

Let's have a look into them. 

### 1. Is Your App Interface Intuitive?

The primary objective is to design an interface that can be accessed with a breeze by both naive and expert users. With legible content and simple design, the interface should showcase the things in a precise way. Encompassing intricate details can make understanding the app a headache. There should be a consistent flow of actions from a page to another and it must be well-designed to ensure the visual consistency throughout the design. 

It is advisable to streamline your design by considering a few incredible features, instead of integrating a range of extraneous features. CTA buttons, typography and other aspects of an interface must be designed and placed to make the UI highly interactive and intuitive. The navigation is yet another thing that must be taken care of to ensure a user-friendly interface and remarkable UX. 

### 2. Make It Speedy!!

The speed of your application is another factor that must be considered. Annoying lags and delays must be avoided, as most of the users abandon an app after getting frustrated with the slow loading speed. It must process rapidly and deliver the appropriate results instantly. Transitions between the pages must be smooth and seamless. If there are some processes that consume time, it must be accompanied by enticing and impressive animations, so as to keep the viewers engaged. 

### 3. First Impression Counts!!

As the saying goes “The first impression is the last impression”, if your application possesses a solid first impression, you can easily attract a bunch of users. Since, mobile users hardly spend a minute or two in evaluating whether an app is worth consuming their valuable mobile storage space or not, a long-lasting first impression can do wonders. An easy navigation and intuitive design can please users and encourage them to further interact with the app. No matter which type of application is it, users are more interested in getting results rapidly with a hassle-free experience. Thus, all the sections of an app must be well-designed to offer an easy accessibility. 

Another challenge is to keep users engaged. Once you have a visually appealing design, the next hurdle is to ensure that the app content is contextual and engaging. It must serve the cause and share useful information, so that it can create a positive impression among your target audience. Thus, it is vital to provide value to your app with relevant content and keep your potential users engaged.

The best way to ensure a pleasing first impression is to ask real users to test your app, before launching it publicly. And then work according to their feedbacks. 

### 4. Keep The Content Updated

To stand ahead of the curve in the wobbly mobile marketplace, it is essential to keep your app content well updated. Sharing updated information with your potential users will help them get accustomed to your app value. There are numerous examples of such applications out there that keep themselves well updated with fresh and relevant data, which certainly add to their credibility and thus, is the key to their success. 

### 5. Integrate Social Media

Almost all of us are aware of the pivotal role that the social media plays in the world of advertisement. Thus, if you want to promote your services or products across the globe, it is viable to integrate some social media buttons in your application. It will certainly allow your users to share your app data with their friends and family in a seamless and convenient fashion. For example, there are several gaming apps that allow players to challenge others by sharing their score on various social media websites. Similarly, many news and video apps allow their viewers to effortlessly share the content with others via social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. 

### 6. Don't Surprise Users With New Mobile Patterns

There are instances when users don't love surprises. If you are trying to amaze them by including a distinct mobile pattern in your application, it can annoy them and ruin their experience, instead of impressing them. Using the icons and navigations with which users are already familiar will help you ensure a superb UX. However, if you will let your users explore the UI and spend time understanding it, there is a great likelihood that it will leave your users frustrated. Thus, it is recommended to study the common patterns for popovers, drawer navigation, forms, icons, etc., beforehand and design your app accordingly to make your users feel at home. 

### Wrapping Up

There are several things that all together contribute to the success of an application. Offline capabilities, functionalities offered, design, usability, visual consistency, and loading speed, are just a few of them. By taking such factors into account, one can achieve your ultimate goal with a successful application in hand. I have enlisted a few of the useful factors in this article. I hope that by keeping these factors in mind while developing the application will help you deliver an incredible app, users will eventually fall in love with.
