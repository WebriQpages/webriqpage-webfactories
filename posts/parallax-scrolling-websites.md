GRAPHENES IS OUT OF THE GATE

It is just a few months ago that we announced the Beta release of our next generation software platform, Graphenes. The development team at WebriQ, has been quite busy in the past two years with crafting one of the most robust Web Content Management Systems and finally, the early adopters have a chance to kick tires as of this last Christmas.

Our WebFactories division was among the first testers and the more we played with the Beta , the more impressed we got and the more keen we grew to use it in one of the next partner projects.

And the opportunity came when our partner, Brandtek wanted to impress their clientele with giving their new website a touch of hype and flashiness in line with their respected image of being a leading and innovative digital agency. A new technique, the parallax scrolling design was a natural choice for a creative agency like Brandtek. And the results were fabulous. Just visit this website that speaks for itself: 

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://brandtek.myresponsive.website/welcome" target="_blank"><img src="/img/uploads/brandtek.jpg"></a></p>

Ross, the creative director of Brandtek, went for the parallax scrolling design not only because it is the latest craze in the industry but he was right to choose this technique as it serves their corporate goals the best.

Many leading brands use it as pivotal element of their online presence and many others jump the bandwagon. In fact too many, in our opinion. Yes, the parallax scrolling technique is great to present the most beautiful face of a brand but it serves not all purposes. Featuring a brand through its graphical artwork, is great for sure but when it comes down to detailed copies and text content that need to speak for the brand, parallax is an overkill.

*We picked for you a few examples, where we think the parallax scrolling designs add a great value to the brand:*

**Graphenes** is a perfect platform to be used in that process as its architecture allows the seamless implementation of special snippets, widgets and JS codes. Furthermore, its content management capabilities and modules allow to add more conservative content elements to the flashy parallax graphics which opens new opportunities for web design companies.
