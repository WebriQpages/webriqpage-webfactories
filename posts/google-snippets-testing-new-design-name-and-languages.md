Google announced improvements to their rich snippet testing resource late last week, featuring a brand-new tag: the **Structured Data Testing Tool.**

There are 3 major adjustments, Google said:

<ul class="circle-list"><li>We have actually improved exactly how we present snippets in the examining device to better match how they exactly show up in searches.</li><li>The brand new aesthetic style makes it more clear what structured information we may extract from the web page, as well as how that might be received our search results.</li><li>The device is right now accessible in foreign languages other than English to aid webmasters from around the world build structured-data-enabled web sites.</li></ul>

The resource is still found in the same place, at the rich snippet tool address. It’s still called the Rich Snippets Testing Tool in Google Webmaster Devices, though that could change website design and development environment.

One more complicated caution is that the WMT Help resource has been updated to show the new solution name, however it still claims it is accessible in English only, in spite of the announcement of new terminologies. It seems the resource records might be a couple of days behind the true announcement.

It collaborates with all plentiful bits as well as authorship markup, featuring:

**Applications
Authors
Events
Tunes
Individuals
Products
Products with several special offers
Recipes
Reviews**

Rich snippets aid the significant online search engine marketing recognize the information of a page and its importance to a provided search query.

One criticism that has sprung up given that the announcement is the new restriction of 1,500 characters for HTML examining. Published web pages may be examined making use of the URL resource, yet those in advancement require to make use of the HTML tester.

Sure I could possibly edit the code to suit the 1500 personality limit, yet then it’s not useful due to the fact that it doesn’t examine the true code. We will not discover out if that’s right till we publish. As well as if the markup is incorrect then it returns in the posting line all over once again.

The most basic kind of authentication for HTTP may be done by riding a username as well as password in the URL, he stated. The username and password can easily be featured in the LINK, so the solution can easily crawl riding the right qualifications.

One issue that has sprung up given that the announcement is the brand-new limit of 1,500 personalities for HTML screening. Released pages can be checked using the URL device, but those in development need to have to make use of the HTML tester. This makes screening extremely difficult for substantial websites with dev web servers that are openly unattainable.

The username and password can easily be included in the URL, so the tool can easily crawl making use of the best references.
